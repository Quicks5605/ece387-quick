Risk Game Module

This module simulates a simplified version of the Risk board game. Players recruit units and battle each other until one side is defeated.

Classes:
    Unit: Represents a generic unit in the game.
    Footman: Represents a Footman unit with specific attributes.
    Archer: Represents an Archer unit with specific attributes.
    Knight: Represents a Knight unit with specific attributes.
    SiegeMachine: Represents a Siege Machine unit with specific attributes.
    Player: Represents a player in the game.
    Risk: Represents the Risk game.

Functions: main: Entry point for the game. Initialize and start the Risk game.
